# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data by Coursera
# Course Project

This is a repository for the course project of the online course Getting and Cleaning Data from Coursera.

You can find information about the code and the data in CodeBook.md.

The R code is for creating a new clean and tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject from the test and train data provided at the link below.

For the code to work properly the data must be extracted in the R working directory.

The R code file 'run_analysis.R'  will generate a text file named 'tidy_data_set_with_averages.txt'.
